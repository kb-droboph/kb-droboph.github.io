Unfortunately packs created before 3.5.2 cannot have their volume size upgraded.  The 5N runs on a 32-bit ARM processor, and uses the Linux ext4 filing system. The maximum volume size that ext4 can support is based on the number of pages the processor can address.  On a 32-bit ARM processor, that ends up being a 2^32 4K pages, which is 16TiB of addressable storage. To go beyond this requires either a 64-bit processor, or a larger page size

Article Id: AA-01391 Last updated date: 11-30-2017 Several factors determine and influence the usable capacity of your Drobo storage device: Your Drobo device's data protection technology uses the largest drive in the disk pack to maintain data redundancy. Example, if you have 4x 1TB drives in Drobo and replace one of your 1TB drives with a single 2TB drive you will not see any gain any usable space.  Since Drobo uses the largest size drive for redundancy you will need to add a second 2TB drive in order to see more usable capacity. The Drobo Capacity Calculator will show you the usable spa

BeyondRAID communicates with your OS about how much disk space you have, up to 16, 32 or 64TB depending on model of Drobo (this varies with older operating and file systems). Specifying a larger amount of storage than is physically available allows you to grow into the volume without having to reformat or migrate your data in order to add capacity.

                  Can a Drobo storage device cause delayed-write failures if its volumes are part of the host computer's real time anti-virus scan? Article Id: AA-01730 Last updated date: 01-29-2015 Yes, delayed-write failures are quite possible when a write to a Drobo device is attempted while an anti-virus client has locked files for access during its real-time virus scan. In order to avoid this problem, exclude the Drobo product's volumes from the real-time scan. If you need to scan your Drobo storage product, schedule its scan for a time when nobody will be trying to access its data. Related Articles: My Drobo storage device causes delayeDROBO

Article Id: AA-01629 Last updated date: 03-28-2017 It is understandable that you would be confused or suspicious if your Drobo product flags a bad drive when the drive works fine in your computer.   If a drive produces a lot of errors in a short amount of time (it's going bad soon), Drobo storage devices display a red blinking light to indicate a failed drive. Your computer may not catch the bad drive as early in its failure process as your Drobo product can. This difference in perception is especially exaggerated if you format the

If you have a large amount of data, the maintenance tasks will be performed more frequently and could take longer to complete.

                  Can I plug in my Drobo storage device to the USB port on the front of my computer? Article Id: AA-01796 Last updated date: 11-30-2017 We recommend avoiding the USB ports on the front of your computer, if possible. The USB ports on the back of your computer are directly connected to the motherboard. However, the front USB ports are usually connected to the motherboard with a cable. In addition, USB ports on older computers are frequently USB 1.1 (not the faster 2.0) ports. Either situation can result in reduced performance. Your data will not travel to and from your Drobo device as quickly.

                  Why isn't the iSCSI connection from my DroboPro to the Mac reconnecting automatically across reboots? Article Id: AA-01722 Last updated date: 11-30-2017 Fortunately, there is a straightforward answer. This is the current and expected behavior if you don't have Drobo Dashboard set to run automatically when the Mac boots. If Drobo Dashboard automatically starts when your computer reboots, then it will keep the iSCSI connection to DroboPro active after booting completes.   © 2019 Mize.

The files in an Aperture library are normally quite big, and you would expect that accessing and transferring large files would be slower than doing so with smaller files. There are a few things you should consider when working with Aperture: Using a USB 2.0 connection with your Drobo storage device is the slowest connection. Try FireWire 800, eSATA (Drobo S only) or iSCSI (DroboPro and DroboElite only) to improve performance. Keeping your main drive

Shut down your computer. Wait for your Drobo device to go into standby: the power light will turn orange or yellow. Unplug the data cable and then the power cord from your Drobo unit. Unplug the power from your computer. If you are using a laptop, remove the battery. Wait at least five minutes. Plug the power back into your computer, turn it on, log in, and start Drobo Dashboard.

Article Id: AA-01120 Last updated date: 11-03-2015 This is an issue relating to Windows-based PCs. We are sorry you are having difficulties. If your PC's System BIOS is set to support legacy USB devices, then your host computer can sometimes fail to start when a non-legacy device (such as Drobo) occupies your USB port. You have two options to solve this dilemma: Unplug your Drobo or DroboPro from your PC's USB port before restarting your PC. Then reconnect it to the USB port once your PC is up and running. Change your System BIOS' sett

Depending upon the situation, you might need to connect to the DroboElite/B800i using the administrative port (USB) to configure your network settings.

Note that each port will have a different IP address and it's own separated performance, which means if you haveÂ three high load targets andÂ three low load targets (forÂ the Drobo B1200i, for example)Â you could connectÂ one high andÂ one low to each IP manually using the Microsoft iSCSI initiator.

Article Id: AA-01720 Last updated date: 01-23-2017 We have found that on certain versions of Mac Pro, the BIOS is causing this pause-and-chime issue. It has trouble recognizing the presence of the attached Drobo device and this causes it to hang for several "chimes" before it boots. If you find this annoying, the workaround is to wait for the Mac Pro to boot up first and then connect the Drobo device afterwards. © 2017 Mize.

A community of users has discovered ways to activate the USB connection so that they can connect external storage. A common approach we've noted is to use the “aTV Flash” from Applecore LLC. They sell a USB stick with installer software that enables the USB connection. It also loads other codecs and media playback software. Of course, we are not making a point of tracking or supporting these tools and approaches since they are not part of our product line. Ho

Article Id: AA-01776 Last updated date: 11-30-2017 Your Drobo product probably sat in inventory for a while at the vendor before you purchased it. That is why there is a difference between what Drobo Dashboard reports as your warranty expiration date and the actual expiration date. Note: Drobo Dashboard no longer displays this type of information, beginning with version 1.2.4 and later. Please contact Drobo Support to have this discrepancy fixed.
